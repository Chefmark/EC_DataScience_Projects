    "As a data analyst there is plenty of opportunity to improve processes or suggest new ways of doing things. When doing so it is often very smart and efficient (time is a scarce resource) to create a POC (Proof of Concept) which basically is a small demo checking wether it is worthwile going further with something. It is also something concrete which facilitates discussions, do not underestimate the power of that. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you are working in a company that sells houses and they have a \"manual\" process of setting prices by humans. You as a Data Scientist can make this process better by using Machine Learning. Your task is to create a POC that you will present to your team colleagues and use as a source of discussion of wether or not you should continue with more detailed modelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two quotes to facilitate your reflection on the value of creating a PoC: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"*Premature optimization is the root of all evil*\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\"*Fail fast*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**More specifially, do the following:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A short EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the housing data set.\n",
    "2. Drop the column \"ocean_proximity\", then you only have numeric columns which will simplify your analysis. Remember, this is a POC!\n",
    "3. Split your data into train and test set. \n",
    "4. Create a pipeline containing a SimpleImputer [ SimpleImputer(strategy=\"median\") ] and a std_scaler (and fit-transform your train set). \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use GridSearchCV when choosing your model. You will look at a RandomForestRegressor with 2, 5, 10 or 100 estimators. More specifically, use the following code: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "param_grid = [{'n_estimators': [2, 5, 10, 100]}]\n",
    "\n",
    "forest_reg = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "grid_search = GridSearchCV(forest_reg, param_grid, cv=3,\n",
    "                           scoring='neg_mean_squared_error',\n",
    "                           return_train_score=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "grid_search.fit(train_feature, train_label)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Evaluate your model on the test set using the mean squared error as the metric. Conclusions? (Remember, you have fitted your pipeline above so now you just transform your test set without fitting your pipeline on it, else it is \"cheating\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Do a short presentation (~ 2-5 min) on your POC that you present to your colleagues (no need to prepare anything particular, just talk from the code). Think of:\n",
    "- What do you want to highlight/present?\n",
    "- What is your conclusion?\n",
    "- What could be the next step? Is the POC convincing enough or is it not worthwile continuing? Do we need to dig deeper into this before taking some decisions?"
